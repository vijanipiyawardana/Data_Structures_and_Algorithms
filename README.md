# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Complexity Analysis

- How to define a good code?
    - Run fast
    - Require less memory
    - Readable
    - Gives correct output

## Data Structures 

- Why data structures?
    - to handle large amounts of data efficiently
    - modern applications and software are manipulating large amounts of data (ex: facebook)
    - can tune the running time complexity of given algorithms by using the appropriate data structure.

- Arrays
- Linked Lists

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

## Algorithms
