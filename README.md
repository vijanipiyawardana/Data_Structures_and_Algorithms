# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Complexity Analysis

- How to define a good code?
    - Run fast
    - Require less memory
    - Readable
    - Gives correct output

## Data Structures [`data_structures`](data_structures)

- Why data structures?
    - to handle large amounts of data efficiently
    - modern applications and software are manipulating large amounts of data (ex: facebook)
    - can tune the running time complexity of given algorithms by using the appropriate data structure.

- Arrays [`arrays`](data_structures/java/arrays/)
- Linked Lists [`linked_list`](data_structures/java/LinkedList/)
- Doubly Linked Lists [`doubly_linked_list`](data_structures/java/DoublyLinkedList/)
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Search Trees
- Balanced Trees: AVL Trees
- Balanced Trees: Red-Black Trees
- Splay Trees
- Binary Heaps
- B-Trees
- Hash Tables
- Tries
- Graphs

## Algorithms [`algorithms`](algorithms)

- Basic Sorting Algorithms
- Advanced Sorting Algorithms
- Searching Algorithms
- Tree Traversals
- Graph Traversals

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

- define the model (logical description) for a certain data structure
- like a supertype in programming (interface or abstract classes)
- defines the basic behaviour, do not specify the implementation or the programming language, etc
- **Abstract Data Types define the behaviour without the implementation** ex: stack, queue
- **Data Structures are the concrete representation and implementations of the underlying data** ex: arrays, linked lists, with which we can implement ADS like stack or queue, **and to achieve as fast running time as possible**
